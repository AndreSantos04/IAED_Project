# IAED_Project
Introduction to Algorithms and Data Structures Projects

This project was made in 2 different deliveries

Both deliveries focus on creating a system of public transportation lines with the given user input, with stops, connections between lines, or creation of new lines.

The first delivery uses simple static data structures.

The second delivery uses linked lists and dynamic arrays, implementing more features than the first one.
